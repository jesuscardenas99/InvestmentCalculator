# InvestmentCalculator
This project is an investment calculator where the user inputs data and recieves how much interest they will recieve. The user will input their initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest, and length. The program will then calculate how much interest they will gain. 
The code has a very friendly user interface that clearly explains what data the user will input. It will also display a detailed breakdown of their investment.
Currently the program has a very simple user interface. While th is makes it easy to understand, it also feels boring and uninspired. I believe enhancing the user interface would lead to a better user experience that is acccessible to more users.
I struggled with how the program instructs users to input their data. If i had a friend use the program they would get confused as to what they should be entering. However, I came up with questions instead of statements and provided an example of what they should be entering. This led to less confusion. 
Learning how to organize my code into functions and classes that have their own functionality will help in future projects by keeping the code organized and readable. 
The names I used give a brief explanation of what the code does makes it to where other developers can understand how the project works. Also the comments I used help with this.
